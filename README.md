# PC4 Cipher
PC4 Encryption cipher for DMR RADIO

PC4 was released in 2015. It's a block cipher specifically designed for DMR radio communication systems. It uses 253 rounds and the key size can vary from 8 bits to 2112 bits. The block size is 49 bits, the exact size of an AMBE+ DMR voiceframe.

The algorithm is used, for example, in the Voice Crypt firmware for the Tytera MD390/MD390 radios :
